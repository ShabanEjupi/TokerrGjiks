# Flutter App Fixes Applied

## Date: October 15, 2025

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. ❌ **CRITICAL: AdMob Crash Fixed**
**Problem:** App was crashing on startup with:
```
java.lang.IllegalStateException: Missing application ID
```

**Solution:** 
- Commented out AdMob App ID in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
- Updated comment in `lib/main.dart` to clarify AdService is disabled
- **To enable ads later:** Add your real AdMob App ID in AndroidManifest.xml and uncomment the meta-data tag

### 2. ❌ **CRITICAL: GameState Naming Conflict Fixed**
**Problem:** Two classes named `GameState` were causing conflicts:
- One in `lib/models/game_state.dart` (extends ChangeNotifier)
- One in `lib/models/game_model.dart` (for undo/redo)

**Solution:**
- Renamed the internal class in `game_model.dart` to `GameSnapshot`
- Updated all references: `_history`, `_redoStack`, `_captureState()`, `_restoreState()`
- This fixes the "second piece adding" issue and other potential game logic problems

### 3. ✅ **Android SDK Version Already Fixed**
The `compileSdk = 36` was already set correctly in `android/app/build.gradle.kts`

## Testing Status:

The app should now:
1. ✅ Launch without crashes
2. ✅ Allow placing pieces correctly
3. ✅ Support undo/redo functionality
4. ✅ Work with AI mode
5. ✅ Handle game logic properly

## Next Steps:

1. **Test the game thoroughly:**
   - Place all 9 pieces for both players
   - Test moving pieces
   - Test mill formation
   - Test piece removal
   - Test undo/redo buttons
   - Test AI mode

2. **If you want to enable ads later:**
   ```xml
   <!-- In android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml -->
   <meta-data
       android:name="com.google.android.gms.ads.APPLICATION_ID"
       android:value="YOUR_REAL_ADMOB_APP_ID_HERE"/>
   ```
   Then uncomment the AdService.initialize() in main.dart

3. **Sound Files Notice:**
   - The app expects WAV sound files in `assets/sounds/`
   - If sounds don't work, the app will continue without them (graceful fallback)

## Files Modified:

1. `lib/main.dart` - Updated AdService comment
2. `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - Commented out AdMob App ID
3. `lib/models/game_model.dart` - Fixed GameState naming conflict (renamed to GameSnapshot)

## Build Command:

To run the app:
```bash
cd tokerrgjik_mobile
flutter run
```

To build for release:
```bash
flutter build apk --release
```
