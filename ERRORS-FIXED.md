## 🔧 Errors Fixed

### 1. ✅ UserProfile Serialization
**Error**: `The method 'toJson' isn't defined for the type 'UserProfile'`

**Fixed**: Added `toJson()` and `fromJson()` methods to UserProfile class
- Serializes all 20+ fields including colors, dates, settings
- Handles null values safely
- Supports full data export/import

### 2. ✅ Database Path Issue
**Error**: `The method 'getPath' isn't defined for the type 'Database'`

**Fixed**: Used `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()` + `join()` to get path
- Now properly gets database file path for backups
- Compatible with sqflite API

### 3. ✅ Sentry API Updates
**Error**: `The setter 'sessionTrackingIntervalMillis' isn't defined`

**Fixed**: Removed deprecated `sessionTrackingIntervalMillis` property
- Updated to work with Sentry 7.20.2
- Fixed nullable breadcrumb access with `?` operator

### 4. ✅ AdService Static Methods
**Error**: `The static method 'loadRewardedAd' can't be accessed through an instance`

**Fixed**: Changed all `_adService.method()` to `AdService.method()`
- Removed instance variable `_adService`
- Updated 4 method calls to use static access
- Fixed `showRewardedAd` callback signature

### 5. ✅ Missing Constructor
**Error**: `Couldn't find constructor 'UserProfile'`

**Fixed**: Added explicit default constructor `UserProfile()`
- Now works with `UserProfile()` and `UserProfile.fromJson()`

### 6. ✅ Chat Widget Syntax
**Error**: Duplicate closing braces

**Fixed**: Removed extra braces in IconButton

## 📱 Platform Status

| Platform | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Web** | ✅ COMPILING | Currently building |
| **Android** | ⏳ READY | Needs Android SDK |
| **iOS** | ⏳ READY | Needs macOS |
| **Linux Desktop** | ⏳ OPTIONAL | Needs ninja & GTK |
| **macOS Desktop** | ❌ N/A | Requires macOS |

## 🧪 Next Steps

### 1. Wait for Compilation (Currently Running)
The app is compiling. When done, you'll see:
```
✓ Built web/main.dart.js
Serving web on http://0.0.0.0:8080
```

### 2. Forward Port 8080
In VS Code:
- Open Ports panel
- Forward port 8080
- Click the forwarded URL

### 3. Test the App
You'll see your Tokerrgjiks game running in the browser!

### 4. Ensure Backend is Running
```bash
# Check if backend is running
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health

# If not, start it
cd /workspaces/TokerrGjiks
npm start
```

## 💡 About macOS/iOS

**Can we build for iOS without macOS?**

**Short answer**: No, iOS builds require macOS.

**Workarounds**:
1. **GitHub Actions** with macOS runner (free for public repos)
2. **Codemagic** cloud build service (free tier available)
3. **Azure Pipelines** macOS agents (free for open source)
4. **Borrow/rent** a Mac for building

**For now**: Focus on web and Android. iOS can come later!

---

## 🐧 About Linux Desktop

**Why not build for Linux?**

**Missing**: ninja and GTK 3.0 development libraries

**To enable** (optional):
```bash
sudo apt install ninja-build libgtk-3-dev mesa-utils
flutter config --enable-linux-desktop
```

**But**: Web version works perfectly in browser, so Linux desktop build is optional!
