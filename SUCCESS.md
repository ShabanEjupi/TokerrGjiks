## ⚠️ Make Sure Backend is Running

Your mobile app needs the backend server. Check if it's running:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

**If you see an error**, start the backend:

```bash
cd /workspaces/TokerrGjiks
npm start
```

Or run in background:
```bash
cd /workspaces/TokerrGjiks
npm start > server.log 2>&1 &
```

```

**2. Check if backend is running:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

```bash
# The terminal should show:
# "lib/main.dart is being served at http://0.0.0.0:8080"
```

**4. Restart Flutter:**
Press `R` in the terminal (hot restart)

### If Backend Errors Appear:

**Start backend:**
```bash
