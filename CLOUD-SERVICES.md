## 🎯 My Recommendation for You:

### For Building Apps:
**Use GitHub Actions** ✅
- Already have access
- Free unlimited
- No signup needed
- I can set it up now!

### For Backend Hosting:
**Use Heroku or DigitalOcean** ✅
- Easy deployment
- Free credits
- Production ready

## 🚫 Why NOT These:

### LocalStack
- Only for AWS emulation
- Doesn't help with mobile builds
- More complex than needed

### Appwrite
- Self-hosted backend (BaaS)
- Good but overkill for your current setup
- Need to host it somewhere first
- Your backend already works!

## 🚀 What I'll Do Now:

### 1. Build Android APK (5 minutes)
Using local Flutter

### 2. Create GitHub Actions Workflow
For automatic building:
- Android APK/AAB
- iOS IPA (on macOS runner)

### 3. Create Deployment Guide
For:
- Heroku (backend)
- DigitalOcean (if preferred)
