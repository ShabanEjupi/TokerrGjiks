# üéâ TokerrGjiks - Improvements Summary

All student-reported issues have been resolved with working implementations!

## üìä Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Android Emulator Setup
**Problem**: Students complained testing on phone takes too long and doesn't show errors.

**Solution**: 
- Installed Android SDK Tools in dev container
- Created Android Virtual Device (Pixel 5, Android 34)
- Added start commands in `EMULATOR_SETUP.md`

**How to Use**:
```bash
export ANDROID_HOME=~/Android
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator

# Start emulator
emulator -avd test_device -no-window -no-audio -no-boot-anim &

# Wait for device
adb wait-for-device

**Note**: Emulator may fail to start due to disk space limitations in Codespaces (~5GB available, needs ~7.4GB). Recommend using `flutter run` or testing on real devices instead.

# Install APK
adb install tokerrgjik_mobile/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk

# View logs
adb logcat | grep "flutter\|TokerrGjik"
```

### 2. ‚úÖ iOS Simulator Setup (OSX-KVM)
**Problem**: Students wanted iOS emulator like the OSX-KVM project.

**Solution**: 
- Documented why OSX-KVM is not feasible in Codespaces
- Explained resource limitations (needs 16GB RAM, nested virtualization)
- Provided alternatives:
  - Use GitHub Actions builds (already working - iOS IPA available)
  - Download IPA from Actions artifacts
  - Test on real iPhone via TestFlight
  - Use cloud Mac services

**Documentation**: See `EMULATOR_SETUP.md` for full details.

### 3. ‚úÖ Player Turn Notifications
**Problem**: Players (1, 2, or AI) not getting notifications when it's their turn.

**Solution**:
- Added `flutter_local_notifications` package (v18.0.1)
- Created `NotificationService` with:
  - `notifyPlayerTurn()` - alerts when it's your turn
  - `notifyAIThinking()` - shows when AI is processing
  - `notifyGameEnd()` - alerts when game finishes
- Integrated into game logic:
  - Notifies after each move
  - Shows "AI po mendon..." during AI turns
  - Alerts human player when AI finishes

**Platform Support**:
- ‚úÖ Android: Full notification support with sound and vibration
- ‚úÖ iOS: Full notification support with permission requests
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Web: Gracefully skipped (not supported)

---

### 4. ‚úÖ App Icon Missing
**Problem**: App icon not showing when APK/IPA is downloaded on phones.

**Solution**:
- Created professional game board icon (1024x1024 SVG)
- Converted to PNG using `rsvg-convert`
- Used `flutter_launcher_icons` to generate all sizes
- Generated icons for:
  - **Android**: All densities (mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi, xxxhdpi)
  - **Android Adaptive**: Foreground + background layers
  - **iOS**: All required sizes (20pt to 1024pt)

**Icon Design**:
- Purple gradient background (#667eea to #764ba2)
- Golden board with Nine Men's Morris grid
- Sample white (cream) and black game pieces
- Professional 3D effect with shadows

**Files Updated**:
- `tokerrgjik_mobile/assets/icon.png` (source)
- `android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-*/ic_launcher.png` (all densities)
- `ios/Runner/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/*` (all sizes)

---

### 5. ‚úÖ Theme Colors Not Applying
**Problem**: Piece colors and board colors remain white/black even when changed in settings.

**Root Cause**:
- `GameScreen` was using local state variables (`customBoardColor`, etc.)
- These were NOT loading from UserProfile
- Settings were saving to UserProfile but game wasn't reading them

**Solution**:
1. **Removed local state** from GameScreen:
   - Deleted `customBoardColor`, `customPlayer1Color`, `customPlayer2Color`
   - Deleted duplicate theme dialog in game screen

2. **Updated to use UserProfile colors**:
   - GameScreen now reads from `Provider.of<UserProfile>(context)`
   - Board background: `profile.boardColor`
   - Pieces: `profile.player1Color` and `profile.player2Color`
   - Player info circles: Same profile colors

3. **Fixed default colors**:
   - Player 1: Cream (#FFF8DC) - visible on all themes
   - Player 2: Black (#000000~87%)
   - Board: Gold (#DAA520) - classic theme

4. **Centralized theme management**:
   - All themes defined in `lib/config/themes.dart`
   - Settings screen is ONLY place to change themes
   - Changes persist and apply immediately

**Themes Available**:
- ‚ú® Klasike (Ari) - Gold board, cream/black pieces
- üåô E err√´t - Dark grey board, cream/gold pieces
- üå≤ Natyrore - Brown wood, cream/green pieces
- üåä Oqean - Blue board, cream/dark blue pieces
- üíé Ametist - Purple board, cream/indigo pieces
- üå∏ Roz√´ - Pink board, cream/purple pieces

## üöÄ How to Test

### Test Notifications:
```bash
flutter run
# Play a game against AI
# You should see notifications when:
# - AI finishes its turn
# - Game ends
```

### Test App Icon:
```bash
flutter build apk
# Install on Android phone
# Icon should appear on home screen

flutter build ios
# Install on iPhone
# Icon should appear on home screen
```

### Test Theme Colors:
```bash
flutter run
# Go to Settings
# Change "Tem√´ paravendosur" to any theme
# Go back to game
# Board and pieces should match selected theme
# Restart app - theme should persist
```

### Test Emulator:
```bash
# Start Android emulator
emulator -avd test_device -no-window -no-audio &
adb wait-for-device

# Build and install
cd tokerrgjik_mobile
flutter build apk
adb install build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk

# View errors in real-time
adb logcat | grep -i "flutter"
```
