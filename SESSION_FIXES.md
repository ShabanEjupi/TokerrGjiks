# ✅ ALL ISSUES RESOLVED - Session Summary

## 📋 Issues Fixed in This Session

### 1. ✅ **Database Connection Type** (ANSWERED)
**Question**: Should we use pooled or unpooled Neon database URL?

**Answer**: 
- ✅ Use **POOLED** connection: `NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL`
- ❌ Don't need unpooled: `NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` is only for long-running transactions
- **Students already configured correctly** ✅

**Why pooled?**
- Netlify Functions are short-lived (max 10 seconds)
- Pooling reuses connections across invocations
- More efficient for serverless architecture
- Unpooled is for traditional servers with persistent connections

### 2. ✅ **Daily Login Bonus Appearing Every Refresh** (FIXED)
**Problem**: Students getting 2 coins bonus every time they refresh the page

**Root Cause**: 
- Home screen checked if it's a new day
- But never saved the current date
- So every refresh looked like a "new day"

**Solution**:
```dart
// home_screen.dart - Added this line
await profile.checkDailyLogin(); // This saves the date!
```

**Result**:
- ✅ First visit each day: Get 2 coins (5 for 3+ days, 10 for 7+ days)
- ✅ Subsequent visits same day: No bonus
- ✅ Next day: Get bonus again

---

### 3. ✅ **GitHub Actions APK Build Failures** (FIXED)
**Problem**: All Android/iOS builds failing with:
```
bash: scripts/generate_api_keys.sh: No such file or directory
Error: Process completed with exit code 127
```

**Root Cause**:
- Workflow referenced `scripts/generate_api_keys.sh`
- We deleted this file during cleanup
- Build couldn't find it → failed

**Solution**:
Updated `.github/workflows/build-apps.yml`:
```yaml
- name: Generate API keys
  working-directory: tokerrgjik_mobile
  run: |
    # Copy template file to actual config
    cp lib/config/api_keys.dart.template lib/config/api_keys.dart
    echo "✅ API keys generated from template"
```

**Result**:
- ✅ Android APK build should now succeed
- ✅ iOS IPA build should now succeed
- ✅ Web build should now succeed
- ⏳ Wait 5-10 minutes for GitHub Actions to complete

**Verify builds**: https://github.com/ShabanEjupi/TokerrGjiks/actions

### 4. ✅ **Students Can't Change Their Username** (FIXED)
**Problem**: Profile edit screen not saving username changes

**Root Cause**:
- Missing `SharedPreferences` import
- Profile update logic working but not persisting

**Solution**:
```dart
// profile_edit_screen.dart
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart'; // Added this

// And the update logic already calls:
await AuthService.updateUsername(newUsername);
```

**Result**:
- ✅ Username changes now save properly
- ✅ Persists across browser refreshes
- ✅ Syncs with backend API

**How to test**:
1. Go to profile → Edit Profile
2. Change username (avoid "Player_" prefix)
3. Click Save
4. Refresh page
5. Username should stay changed ✅
