# üö® CRITICAL: Deployment Instructions - FOLLOW IN ORDER

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ALL FUNCTIONS ARE CRASHING - FIX REQUIRED IMMEDIATELY

Your Netlify Functions are crashing because **NEON_DATABASE_URL is not set**. Follow these steps in order:

---

## üìã STEP 1: Set Database Environment Variable (CRITICAL - DO THIS FIRST)

### 1.1 Get Your Neon Database URL
1. Go to: https://console.neon.tech/
2. Select your **tokerrgjiks** project
3. Click **"Connection Details"** or **"Dashboard"**
4. Copy the connection string - it looks like:
   ```
   postgresql://username:password@ep-xyz-123.region.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
   ```

### 1.2 Add to Netlify (THIS FIXES THE CRASHES)
1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/
2. Select your **tokerrgjik** site
3. Go to: **Site settings** ‚Üí **Environment variables**
4. Click **"Add a variable"**
5. **Key:** `NEON_DATABASE_URL`
6. **Value:** Paste your PostgreSQL connection string from Neon
7. Click **"Save"**
8. Go to **Deploys** tab ‚Üí Click **"Trigger deploy"** ‚Üí **"Deploy site"**

**‚úÖ THIS WILL FIX:** All 9 functions crashing with "No database connection string" error

---

## üìã STEP 2: Run Database Schema (FIX BLANK LEADERBOARD)

### 2.1 Execute SQL in Neon Console
1. Go to: https://console.neon.tech/
2. Click **"SQL Editor"** in left sidebar
3. Open file: `database_schema.sql` from your project
4. Copy ALL the SQL code
5. Paste into Neon SQL Editor
6. Click **"Run"** button
7. Verify success: Check that tables `users`, `game_history`, `friends`, `game_sessions`, `achievements` were created

**‚úÖ THIS WILL FIX:** Blank leaderboard, missing user data, friends not working

---

## üìã STEP 3: Add PayPal Credentials (FIX PAYMENTS)

### 3.1 Get PayPal Sandbox Credentials
1. Go to: https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard/
2. Login with your PayPal account
3. Go to: **Apps & Credentials** ‚Üí **Sandbox**
4. If no app exists, click **"Create App"**
5. Copy these two values:
   - **Client ID** (starts with "A...")
   - **Secret** (hidden, click "Show")

### 3.2 Add to Your Flutter App
1. Open: `tokerrgjik_mobile/lib/config/payment_config.dart`
2. Find lines 8-9:
   ```dart
   static const String paypalClientId = 'YOUR_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID_HERE';
   static const String paypalSecret = 'YOUR_PAYPAL_SECRET_HERE';
   ```
3. Replace with your actual values:
   ```dart
   static const String paypalClientId = 'AZabc123...';
   static const String paypalSecret = 'ELabc123...';
   ```
4. Save the file

**‚úÖ THIS WILL FIX:** PayPal payment gateway not opening, payments failing

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: Functions still crashing after setting NEON_DATABASE_URL

2. Trigger new deploy: Deploys ‚Üí Trigger deploy ‚Üí Deploy site
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete
4. Hard refresh browser: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

### Problem: Leaderboard still blank
**Solution:**

4. Verify payment_config.dart was rebuilt: `flutter build web --release`
5. Clear browser cache and hard refresh

### Problem: Username still showing "Player_1234"
**Solution:**
1. Verify database connection is working (see above)
2. Click profile ‚Üí Edit Profile ‚Üí Change username manually
3. If error appears, check browser console for API response
4. Verify PUT /users/profile endpoint is working: Check Netlify function logs

### Problem: Multiplayer lobby empty
**Solution:**
1. This is normal if no active games exist
2. Click "Create Game" button to start a new session
3. Open app in another browser/device to see lobby refresh
4. Sessions auto-refresh every 5 seconds

### Problem: Friend requests not appearing
**Solution:**
