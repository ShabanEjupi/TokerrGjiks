# TOKERRGJIK GAME - COMPLETE FIX DOCUMENTATION

## Problems Identified

### 1. **CRITICAL: App Crashing on Startup** ‚ùå
**Error:**
```
java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to get provider com.google.android.gms.ads.MobileAdsInitProvider
Missing application ID. AdMob publishers should follow the instructions...
```

**Root Cause:**
- The `google_mobile_ads` package requires a valid AdMob App ID in `AndroidManifest.xml`
- No App ID was configured, causing immediate crash on app startup
- Even though ads were commented out in `main.dart`, the package still initializes automatically

**Fix Applied:**
- ‚úÖ Removed `google_mobile_ads: ^5.1.0` from `pubspec.yaml`
- ‚úÖ Created stub `AdService` class that doesn't require Google Mobile Ads SDK
- ‚úÖ All ad-related functionality now uses stub (safe fallbacks)
- ‚úÖ App will no longer crash on startup

### 2. **Gameplay Issue: Second Piece Not Placing** üéÆ
**Symptom:**
- After placing first piece, second piece wouldn't place correctly
- Turn switching was confusing/broken

**Root Cause:**
- In `game_screen.dart`, the `_makeAIMoveIfNeeded()` function had incorrect logic
- After AI removed an opponent's piece (after forming a mill), it would call `game.switchPlayer()` again
- This caused double-switching: `removePiece()` already switches player internally
- Result: The same player would get another turn, breaking game flow

**Fix Applied:**
- ‚úÖ Fixed `_makeAIMoveIfNeeded()` to not double-switch players
- ‚úÖ Properly check if AI needs to remove piece after forming mill
- ‚úÖ Removed redundant `switchPlayer()` calls
- ‚úÖ Game turn logic now follows proper Nine Men's Morris rules

### 3. **Warning: Java Version Obsolete** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Warning:**
```
warning: [options] source value 8 is obsolete and will be removed in a future release
warning: [options] target value 8 is obsolete and will be removed in a future release
```

**Fix Applied:**
- ‚úÖ Updated `android/app/build.gradle.kts`:
  - `sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_17`
  - `targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_17`
  - `jvmTarget = JavaVersion.VERSION_17`

### 4. **Warning: Android SDK Version Mismatch** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Warning:**
```
Your project is configured to compile against Android SDK 35, but plugins require SDK 36
```

**Fix Applied:**
- ‚úÖ Updated `android/app/build.gradle.kts`:
  - `compileSdk = 36`
  - `targetSdk = 36`

## Files Modified

### 1. `pubspec.yaml`
```yaml
# BEFORE:
google_mobile_ads: ^5.1.0

# AFTER:
# google_mobile_ads: ^5.1.0  # REMOVED - Requires valid AdMob App ID
```

### 2. `lib/services/ad_service.dart`
Completely rewritten as stub implementation:
- No dependency on `google_mobile_ads`
- All methods return safely (no crashes)
- Debug mode gives test rewards
- Includes documentation on how to enable ads in future

### 3. `lib/main.dart`
```dart
// BEFORE:
import 'package:tokerrgjik_mobile/services/ad_service.dart';
// try {
//   await AdService.initialize();
// } catch (e) { ... }

// AFTER:
import 'package:tokerrgjik_mobile/services/ad_service.dart';  // Now using stub
// AdService initialization calls work but do nothing
```

### 4. `lib/screens/game_screen.dart`
Fixed `_makeAIMoveIfNeeded()`:
```dart
// BEFORE:
if (game.phase == 'removing') {
  // ...
  game.switchPlayer();  // ‚ùå WRONG: Double switching!
}

// AFTER:
if (game.phase == 'removing' && game.currentPlayer == game.aiPlayer) {
  // ...
  // removePiece() already switches player ‚úì
}
```

### 5. `android/app/build.gradle.kts`
```kotlin
// UPDATED:
compileSdk = 36  // Was 35
targetSdk = 36   // Was 35
sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_17  // Was 11
targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_17  // Was 11
jvmTarget = JavaVersion.VERSION_17  // Was 11
```

## Future: Enabling Real Ads

If you want to enable ads in the future:

### Step 1: Get AdMob App ID
1. Go to https://admob.google.com
2. Create account / Sign in
3. Create new app
4. Get your App ID (format: `ca-app-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX~YYYYYYYYYY`)

### Step 2: Update pubspec.yaml
```yaml
dependencies:
  google_mobile_ads: ^5.1.0  # Uncomment this
```

### Step 3: Update AndroidManifest.xml
Add to `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:
```xml
<application>
    <!-- Add this inside <application> tag -->
    <meta-data
        android:name="com.google.android.gms.ads.APPLICATION_ID"
        android:value="ca-app-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX~YYYYYYYYYY"/>
</application>
```

### Step 4: Replace ad_service.dart
Replace stub with real implementation (backup available in git history)
