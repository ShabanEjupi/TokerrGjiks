## 🔧 What YOU Need to Do (via Terminal):

### Step 1: Set Up GitHub Secrets (REQUIRED for builds to work)

Run the interactive setup script:
```bash
cd /workspaces/TokerrGjiks
bash scripts/setup_github_secrets.sh
```

This will walk you through adding all your API keys as GitHub secrets.
The AdMob keys from your students are pre-filled, just press Enter to use them.

**OR** do it manually via GitHub CLI:
```bash
# AdMob secrets (your students provided these)
gh secret set ADMOB_APP_ID_ANDROID -b "ca-app-pub-8491001524308476~9753001043"
gh secret set ADMOB_APP_ID_IOS -b "ca-app-pub-8491001524308476~5326670873"
gh secret set ADMOB_BANNER_ANDROID -b "ca-app-pub-8491001524308476/7116257088"
gh secret set ADMOB_BANNER_IOS -b "ca-app-pub-8491001524308476/4681665438"
gh secret set ADMOB_INTERSTITIAL_ANDROID -b "ca-app-pub-8491001524308476/9581997693"
gh secret set ADMOB_INTERSTITIAL_IOS -b "ca-app-pub-8491001524308476/5179718251"
gh secret set ADMOB_REWARDED_ANDROID -b "ca-app-pub-8491001524308476/8248347684"
gh secret set ADMOB_REWARDED_IOS -b "ca-app-pub-8491001524308476/3041280706"
```

### Step 2: Set Up Netlify Deployment

```bash
# Login to Netlify (will open browser)
netlify login

# Link the repository to Netlify
cd /workspaces/TokerrGjiks
netlify init

# Follow the prompts:
# - Choose "Create & configure a new site"
# - Choose your team
# - Site name: tokerrgjik (or whatever you prefer)
# - Build command: (leave empty, using netlify.toml)
# - Deploy directory: (leave empty, using netlify.toml)

# Deploy now
netlify deploy --prod
```

### Step 3: Add Other Service Keys (Optional, as you get them)

When you get keys for other services, add them via terminal:

```bash
# Stripe (for payments)
gh secret set STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY -b "pk_test_YOUR_KEY_HERE"
gh secret set STRIPE_SECRET_KEY -b "sk_test_YOUR_KEY_HERE"

# Sentry (for error tracking)
gh secret set SENTRY_DSN -b "https://YOUR_DSN@sentry.io/PROJECT_ID"

# New Relic (for monitoring)
gh secret set NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY -b "YOUR_LICENSE_KEY"

# DevCycle (for feature flags)
gh secret set DEVCYCLE_SDK_KEY -b "YOUR_SDK_KEY"

# Blockchair (for blockchain data)
gh secret set BLOCKCHAIR_API_KEY -b "YOUR_API_KEY"

# Icons8 (if using their API)
gh secret set ICONS8_API_KEY -b "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Step 4: Update Local API Keys

For local development, update the API keys file:
```bash
# Edit the file
code tokerrgjik_mobile/lib/config/api_keys.dart

# Or use the template
cp tokerrgjik_mobile/lib/config/api_keys.dart.template tokerrgjik_mobile/lib/config/api_keys.dart
# Then edit with your keys
```

### Step 5: Verify Everything Works

```bash
# Check GitHub Actions status
gh run list

# Or open in browser
gh run view --web

# Check Netlify deployment
netlify open
```

## 📚 Documentation Created:

1. **SETUP_GUIDE.md** - Comprehensive guide for all services
2. **scripts/setup_github_secrets.sh** - Interactive script to add secrets
3. **scripts/generate_api_keys.sh** - Auto-generates api_keys.dart in CI/CD
4. **netlify.toml** - Netlify configuration for web deployment

## 🎯 Current Status:

### ✅ Completed:
- AdMob configuration (2 points for rewarded ads)
- Favicons and app icons
- Netlify configuration
- GitHub Actions workflow (will work once secrets are added)
- All service configurations in api_keys.dart
- Setup documentation

### ⏳ Waiting for You:
- Add GitHub secrets (run `bash scripts/setup_github_secrets.sh`)
- Connect to Netlify (run `netlify login && netlify init`)
- Get API keys for optional services (Stripe, Sentry, etc.)

- Settings > Secrets: https://github.com/ShabanEjupi/TokerrGjiks/settings/secrets/actions
- Netlify Dashboard: https://app.netlify.com (after login)

## 🆘 If GitHub Actions Still Fail:

After adding secrets, trigger a new build:
```bash
# Push an empty commit to trigger workflow
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger build after adding secrets"
git push origin main

# Or trigger manually
gh workflow run "Build Android & iOS Apps"
```

## 📝 Notes:

- The `gh-pages` branch didn't exist, so nothing to delete
- Netlify is now the deployment method (better than GitHub Pages)
- All API keys are secure (not committed to git)
- GitHub Actions auto-generates api_keys.dart from secrets
- Rewarded ads give 2 points as requested
