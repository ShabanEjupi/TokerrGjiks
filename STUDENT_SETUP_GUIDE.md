# üöÄ Quick Setup Guide for Students

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Do This First!

### 1. Setup Neon Database (Required for ALL features)

**Without this step, login, leaderboard, multiplayer, and statistics won't work!**

#### Step-by-Step:

1. **Create Database**:
   ```
   ‚Ä¢ Go to: https://console.neon.tech
   ‚Ä¢ Click "Create Project"
   ‚Ä¢ Copy the connection string (looks like):
     postgresql://user:password@ep-abc123.region.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
   ```

2. **Initialize Database**:
   ```
   ‚Ä¢ In Neon Console, click "SQL Editor"
   ‚Ä¢ Open file: scripts/init_neon_database.sql
   ‚Ä¢ Copy ALL contents
   ‚Ä¢ Paste into SQL Editor
   ‚Ä¢ Click "Run"
   ‚Ä¢ Wait for: "Database initialized successfully! ‚úÖ"
   ```

3. **Configure Netlify** (CRITICAL):
   ```
   ‚Ä¢ Go to: https://app.netlify.com
   ‚Ä¢ Select your site
   ‚Ä¢ Site Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   ‚Ä¢ Click "Add a variable"
   ‚Ä¢ Key: NEON_DATABASE_URL
   ‚Ä¢ Value: [paste your connection string from step 1]
   ‚Ä¢ Save
   ‚Ä¢ Deploy ‚Üí Trigger deploy
   ```

### 2. Test Your Setup

After deploying, test these endpoints:

```bash
# Health check

# Should return: {"status":"ok","message":"API is running"}
```
