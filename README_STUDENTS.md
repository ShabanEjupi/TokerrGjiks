## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Leaderboard is empty"
**Fix:** Run `database_schema.sql` in Neon (creates sample users)

### "User not found" in friend search
**Fix:** Make sure database schema was run (creates sample users)

### "Database connection failed" on health check
**Fix:** Verify `NEON_DATABASE_URL` is set correctly in Netlify

### Shop page still grey on web
**Fix:** Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete) and hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)

### Changes not appearing on website
**Fix:** 
1. Professor needs to rebuild: `cd tokerrgjik_mobile && flutter build web --release`
2. And redeploy: `git add -A && git commit -m "Update" && git push`
