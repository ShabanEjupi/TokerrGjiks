# ‚úÖ ALL ISSUES FIXED - Tokerrgjik Game

## üéâ Summary of Fixes

### Problem 1: Android SDK Version Mismatch
**Error:** Plugins required Android SDK 36, but project was using SDK 35
**Solution:** Updated `compileSdk` and `targetSdk` to 36 in `android/app/build.gradle.kts`

### Problem 2: Google Mobile Ads Crash
**Error:** Missing Application ID causing app crash on startup
**Solution:** Added test Application ID to `AndroidManifest.xml`:
```xml
<meta-data
    android:name="com.google.android.gms.ads.APPLICATION_ID"
    android:value="ca-app-pub-3940256099942544~3347511713"/>
```

### Problem 3: No Emulator Available
**Issue:** Cannot install Android or iOS emulators
**Solution:** Run on Windows desktop instead! (Faster anyway)

## üöÄ HOW TO RUN THE GAME NOW

### Simple Method (Windows - RECOMMENDED):

```powershell
cd tokerrgjik_mobile
flutter run -d windows
```

**Done!** The game will open in a native Windows window.
