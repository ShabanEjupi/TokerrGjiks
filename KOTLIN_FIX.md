# ðŸ”§ APK Build Fix - Kotlin Language Version

## Problem

The APK build in GitHub Actions was failing with this error:

```
Language version 1.4 is no longer supported; please, use version 1.6 or greater.
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
Execution failed for task ':sentry_flutter:compileReleaseKotlin'.
```

## Root Cause

The `sentry_flutter` plugin (version 7.20.2) requires Kotlin language version 1.6 or higher, but the Android project wasn't explicitly specifying the Kotlin language version, causing it to default to an older version that's incompatible with Sentry.

## Solution

Updated the Kotlin configuration in two places:

### 1. **android/build.gradle.kts** (Root level)
Added a configuration block to set Kotlin language version for all subprojects:

```kotlin
subprojects {
    tasks.withType<org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.tasks.KotlinCompile> {
        kotlinOptions {
            jvmTarget = "17"
            languageVersion = "1.9"  // Required by Sentry
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. **android/app/build.gradle.kts** (App level)
Added the language version to the app's Kotlin options:

```kotlin
kotlinOptions {
    jvmTarget = JavaVersion.VERSION_17.toString()
    languageVersion = "1.9"  // Set Kotlin language version for Sentry compatibility
}
```

## Why Kotlin 1.9?

- Kotlin 1.9 is stable and widely supported
- Compatible with Kotlin compiler version 2.1.0 (already configured in settings.gradle.kts)
- Meets the minimum requirement of 1.6+ for Sentry
- Future-proof for other modern dependencies

## Changes Made

**Files Modified:**
1. `tokerrgjik_mobile/android/build.gradle.kts`
2. `tokerrgjik_mobile/android/app/build.gradle.kts`

**Commits:**
- `d0ea293` - Fix Kotlin language version for Android build
- `cdc58eb` - Restore documentation files

## Testing

The fix has been pushed to GitHub and will be validated by the GitHub Actions workflow.

**To monitor the build:**
```bash
# Check build status
gh run list

# View the running build
gh run view --web

# Or check directly at:
# https://github.com/ShabanEjupi/TokerrGjiks/actions
```

## Expected Outcome

âœ… Android APK build should now succeed
âœ… iOS build should continue to work (uses Swift, not affected)
âœ… Web build should continue to work (no Kotlin involved)

## Additional Notes

- The Kotlin compiler version (2.1.0) in `settings.gradle.kts` is already correct
- This fix only affects the **language version** used for compilation
- All other dependencies remain unchanged
- No changes needed to the Flutter/Dart code

## If Build Still Fails

If you see other errors:

1. **Check for missing GitHub Secrets:**
   ```bash
   # Run the interactive setup script
   bash scripts/setup_github_secrets.sh
   ```

2. **View detailed logs:**
   ```bash
   gh run view <RUN_ID> --log-failed
   ```

3. **Clean build and retry:**
   - GitHub Actions will automatically do a clean build
   - Locally: `flutter clean && flutter pub get`

**Status:** âœ… Fix applied and pushed to GitHub
**Build:** Currently running - check Actions tab
**Next:** Wait for build to complete, then download APK from artifacts
